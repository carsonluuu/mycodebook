### SOLID principles 

The SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design include these five principles:

[SRP – Single Responsibility Principle](https://deviq.com/single-responsibility-principle)

[OCP – Open/Closed Principle](https://deviq.com/open-closed-principle)

[LSP – Liskov Substitution Principle](https://deviq.com/liskov-substitution-principle)

[ISP – Interface Segregation Principle](https://deviq.com/interface-segregation-principle)

[DIP – Dependency Inversion Principle](https://deviq.com/dependency-inversion-principle)

###  Object-Oriented Programming \(OOP\)

**Encapsulation** is achieved when each object keeps its state **private**, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.

**Abstraction** can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation. Applying abstraction means that each object should **only **expose a high-level mechanism for using it.

**Inheritance** Objects are often very similar. They share common logic. But they’re not **entirely **the same. The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class \(common part\) and can implement its own \(unique part\).

**polymorphism** gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
