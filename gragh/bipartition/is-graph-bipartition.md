# Is Graph Bipartite

Given an undirected `graph`, return`true`if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is\_bipartite\_if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form:`graph[i]`is a list of indexes`j`for which the edge between nodes`i`and`j`exists.  Each node is an integer between`0`and`graph.length - 1`.  There are no self edges or parallel edges:`graph[i]`does not contain`i`, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

```
1.graph will have length in range [1, 100].
2.graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
3.graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
4.The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].
```

### Example

```
Input:
 [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]

Output:
 true

Explanation:

The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

```
Input:
 [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]

Output:
 false

Explanation:

The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
```

### Note

1. Assign RED color to the source vertex \(putting into set U\).  
2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color \(putting into set V\).  
3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color \(putting into set U\).  
4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.  
5. While assigning colors, **if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex**, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices \(or graph is not Bipartite\)

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        if (graph == null || graph.length == 0) return false;
        int[] color = new int[graph.length];
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        //Divide the node in two sets such that no two nodes in same set are linked
        //[[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (color[i] == 0) {
                //color and send in queue
                q.offer(i);
                color[i] = 1;
                while (!q.isEmpty()) {
                    int node = q.poll();
                    for (int child : graph[node]) {
                        if (color[child] == 0) {
                            //color distinct color
                            if (color[node] == 2) color[child] = 1;
                            else color[child] = 2;
                            q.offer(child);
                        } else if (color[child] == color[node]) {
                            return false;
                        }                  
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
